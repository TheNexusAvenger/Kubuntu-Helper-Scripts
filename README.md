#Kubuntu Helper Scripts
Set of helper scripts I use to set up Kubuntu for personal use. Including:
* `Install.py` - Installs an individual application.
* `Presets.py` - Installs a group of applications.

##Why not just use `apt`?
A bunch of the applications I use are not a simple `sudo apt install`, and
some are much more complicated. These scripts also allow me to set up
multiple systems with Kubuntu more easily since I maintain 2 personal
systems currently and sometimes a few virtual machines.

#Contributing
While GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are open, these scripts are intended
for personal use on Kubuntu. No expectations exist for support.
